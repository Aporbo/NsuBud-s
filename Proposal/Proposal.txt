\Large{\underline{\textbf{Introduction}}} \\
  \end{center}
\normalsize\\
Social media allows individuals to interact with people for various purposes. Nowadays it's way easier to connect with people through social media rather than meeting physically. For students, there might be some issues getting the precise platform having the right content and good internal link. That's why there seems to have some leakage of information among students who are willing to approach any particular individual from the institution. So, here we tried to introduce a website that has the particular purpose for communicating only NSU students & faculties. The features in this website will provide the user to be notified pieces of information and so on by which we can have our very own community and connections. It will be new, secure and handy platform for 
everyone. As like all others platforms, it will have all the features except irrelevants.\\
\begin{center}
\Large{\underline{\textbf{Objective}}} \\
 \end{center}
\normalsize
\begin{enumerate}
\item To access any individual from the university.
\item To follow someone whom one admires. 
\item To increase communication and links for any assist.
\item Having the safest platform to share one's activities & information.
\item Notify the university students about any branding & advertising proceedings.
\item conduct surveys through this website and ask anyone in their reach to voice their opinions.
\item Get to know about the university more.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
\LARGE{{\underline{Value Proposition}}} \\
\end{center}
\normalsize
This website will reduce the hassle of finding any student or faculty from the university. The site will have authentic and verified users that will be secured enough to share any information about the university. Students will be aware of having enough information about the faculties with whom they are willing to do researches or other activities. This will help the student to find the appropriate supervisor for the desired platform. Most significantly, it will scale down wasting unnecessary time on social media and viewing only the relevant and essential information only.

}}} \\
 \end{center}
 \normalsize
 The website will open with the user view at first. It will be a general view and anyone accessing the domain will be able to view it. This view will show the newsfeed where the user will have an overview of the activities who he/she follows. The user has to create an account first with NSU ID and required information. Once a user has created an account, he/she can:
  \begin{itemize}
\item Able to visit the newsfeed
\item Searching any user
\item Adding new followers
\item Send messages
\item Have notifications
\item Update status
\item Upload photos
\item Reacting any post

\Large{\underline{\textbf{Challenges}}} \\
\end{center}
\normalsize
One of the biggest challenges is cost. As there will be huge data like images, messages, posts, comments, and notifications, there may be a chance of high-cost maintenance. The second challenge will be the verification of data. We will need to check if the
data entered are reliable or not. Although every students and faculties have their own ID cards but to access the database will not be easy, much processing needs to be done. Lastly, UI also needs to be simple and easy so that normal people can also use it.\
